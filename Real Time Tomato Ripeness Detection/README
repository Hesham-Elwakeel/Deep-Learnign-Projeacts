# Tomato Ripeness Detection

This project is a **deep learning application** that detects the ripeness of tomatoes from images.

---

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Python**  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** for the deep learning model  
- **Gradio** for creating the interactive web interface  
- **PIL / NumPy** for image processing  

---

## ðŸ”¹ How it Works
1. Upload an image of a tomato.  
2. The app preprocesses the image and resizes it to 224x224.  
3. A fine-tuned CNN model predicts the ripeness: **Mature** or **Immature**.  
4. The result and confidence score are displayed on the interface.
